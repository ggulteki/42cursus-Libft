Summary (from en.subject.pdf):

This project is about coding a C library.
It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library.
